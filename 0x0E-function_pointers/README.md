# C - Function pointers
* 0 - Write a function that prints a name.
* 1 - Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
- Prototype: void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int));
- where size is the size of the array
- and action is a pointer to the function you need to use
* 2 - Write a function that searches for an integer.

Prototype: int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int));
where size is the number of elements in the array array
cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values
int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0
If no element matches, return -1
If size <= 0, return -1

3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at mandatory

Write a program that performs simple operations.

You are allowed to use the standard library
Usage: calc num1 operator num2
The program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line
num1, num2 are integers. Use the atoi function to convert them to int
operator is one of the following:
+: addition
-: subtraction
*: multiplication
/: division
%: modulo
You can assume that the result of all operations can be stored in an int
if the number of arguments is wrong, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 98
if the operator is none of the above, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 99
This task requires that you create four different files.

3-op_functions.c

This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):

op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);
op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);
op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);
op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);
op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);
3-get_op_func.c

This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. You're not allowed to declare any other function.

Prototype: int (*get_op_func(char *s))(int, int);
where s is the operator passed as argument to the program
This function returns a pointer to the function that corresponds to the operator given as a parameter. Example: get_op_func("+") should return a pointer to the function op_add
You are not allowed to use switch statements
You are not allowed to use for or do ... while loops
You are not allowed to use goto
You are not allowed to use else
You are not allowed to use more than one if statement in your code
You are not allowed to use more than one while loop in your code
If s does not match any of the 5 expected operators (+, -, *, /, %), return NULL
3-main.c

This file should contain your main function only.

You are not allowed to code any other function that main in this file
You are not allowed to directly call op_add, op_sub, op_mul, op_div or op_mod from the main function
You have to use atoi to convert arguments to int
You are not allowed to use any kind of loop
You are allowed to use a maximum of 3 if statements
3-calc.h

This file should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program.
